The controller cannot operater in SAL without TMA inclination
6086	Loss of TMA Communications	Warning	Communications	Unchanged	The MTMount.MotionParameters telemetry is not available when in or transitioning to the Enable state	Issue a warning when the MTMount motion parameters are not available when NOT in Enable. The controller does not need the MTMount parameters at this time, therefore -> warning
6087	User Identified Error (Emergency Stop)	Fault	Communications	Fault State	The user identifies an error condition that is not detectable via SAL.	A button is created on the EUI to inject a fault to the controller to allow state transitions when the SAL comm link is lost. Since there is no signal available to identify a loss of SAL comm, the state machine is stranded when SAL is lost. This fault kicks the state machine over to the fault state and allows the system to transition to a safe state where comm can be re-initialized. Can also be used to transition the system to the fault state when issues are observed and not captured under existing fault codes
